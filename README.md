**Analysis of Animal Crossing: New Horizons**

This repository is dedicated to my first documented data analysis project using python.

I chose to analyze data regarding **'Animal Crossing: New Horizons.'** 

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Horizons):

"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a social simulation game developed and published by Nintendo in 2020 for the Nintendo Switch; it is the fifth main entry in the Animal Crossing series. In New Horizons, the player controls a character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, accomplishes assigned tasks, and develops the island as they choose. They can gather and craft items, customize the island, and develop it into a community of anthropomorphic animals.Animal Crossing: New Horizons[b] is a social simulation game developed and published by Nintendo in 2020 for the Nintendo Switch; it is the fifth main entry in the Animal Crossing series.

While there are many great tools for a data analyst to utilize, python is a very well-rounded tool that helps us with data manipulation, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization. 

I plan on using different tools for the following projects to demonstrate my versatility within the realm of data analysis. 

I chose to use Python for my first project because I feel that the programming language aligns with my versatility and seems to be emerging as one of the most popular and desired skills among successful analysts.
